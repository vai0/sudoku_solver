Sudoku Solver
=============

Currently the solver assumes the following conditions:

  - puzzle is entered into solver method as a 2D-array. 
  - all integers are between (1..9)
  - blank positions are set as 0
  - entered as 2D-array
 
#####Example argument:

        puzzle = 
           [[6,0,0,1,0,8,2,0,3],
            [0,2,0,0,4,0,0,9,0],
            [8,0,3,0,0,5,4,0,0],
            [5,0,4,6,0,7,0,0,9],
            [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,5,0],
            [7,0,0,8,0,3,1,0,2],
            [0,0,1,7,0,0,9,0,6],
            [0,8,0,0,3,0,0,2,0],
            [3,0,2,9,0,4,0,0,5]]
